Basic Request-Response Setup:
Username and Email in the POST request (both optional arguments)
Irrespective of the request fields, the response should be identical

DB particulars:
1. By default an account is considered primary., with linked_id as NULL
2. If another is present with same phone number/email, account is considered 'secondary'., with linked_id as 'id_of_primary'

States:-
1. If user does not exist => Create user with the information provided with "primary"
2. if user exists:-
    a. Has same email or phone number as request => Create new user with "secondary".
    b. If both fields are same => Just return
    c. If there exists two or more records
    that match such that one email is matched
    and other phone  => Account created first is condiered primary, other is secondary.
